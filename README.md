I developed this small project for a company as a techincal assignment test. I followed the following requirements

1. Use modern HTML to produce a semantic information structure.
2. Use modern CSS to produce the layout with a mobile first approach  
   _Should support screen resolutions from small screens (320px+) up to big screens (1920px+)_
3. Fetch JSON-data from the following url: ```/api/games/lists.json```
4. Use React to generate the elements/components based on the fetched JSON-data.
5. Create a search/filter component based upon the JSON-data.
   - Implement your own design for the search/filter component
   - Should be a component
   - Should filter the JSON-data based on user input
   - Should display up to 10 previous searches
   - Should persist search history on reload  
     _**Don't** use autocomplete="on"_
